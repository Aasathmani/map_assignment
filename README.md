In the application I have created three pages 
  1. Mobile number or email login
  2. If we use mobile number it goes to otp page
  3. Please Use OTP as "1234"-> I would hardcode that value for temporary
  4. If we use email login it directly goes to profile page
  5. Initially it was showing create profile
  6. In profile page all fields are manditory
  7. Validation also done for all fields.
  8. All the field are filled then only we can able to create a profile
  9. Once creation done the app bar name changed into profile
  10. If you want edit the profile ,In the app bar edit button is there.
  11. After tapping we can able to edit the fields and updare the profile .

Approch :
1. BLOC architucture
2. state changes are done by BLOC architecture
3. Each things will wriiten as seprate file like UI will be seperate ,event handler handled seperatly , state changes handled individually, logics are implemented indivudually
4. BLOC is clean architecture
